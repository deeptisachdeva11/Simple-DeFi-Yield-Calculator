# Simple DeFi Yield Calculator

## Description of the Project

The Simple DeFi Yield Calculator is a smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that enables users to stake their AptosCoin tokens and earn yield based on configurable annual percentage rates. This foundational DeFi protocol provides a transparent and decentralized way for users to grow their cryptocurrency holdings through time-locked staking positions.

The smart contract features two core functions: creating staking positions with custom yield rates and calculating real-time yield earnings based on the time elapsed since staking. Users can stake any amount of AptosCoin, set their desired annual yield rate, and monitor their accumulated returns through on-chain calculations that ensure complete transparency and immutability.

Built with simplicity and security in mind, this contract serves as a building block for more complex DeFi applications while maintaining the essential functionality needed for yield generation in decentralized finance.

## Vision of the Project

Our vision is to democratize access to yield-generating opportunities in the decentralized finance ecosystem by providing a simple, transparent, and secure staking mechanism on the Aptos blockchain. We aim to create a foundational layer that empowers users to earn passive income from their cryptocurrency holdings without relying on traditional financial intermediaries.

By leveraging the speed, security, and low transaction costs of the Aptos blockchain, we envision a future where anyone, regardless of their technical expertise or financial background, can participate in DeFi yield generation. Our goal is to foster financial inclusion and provide users with full control over their assets while earning competitive returns.

The project represents our commitment to building trustless financial infrastructure that prioritizes user sovereignty, transparency, and accessibility in the rapidly evolving world of decentralized finance.
